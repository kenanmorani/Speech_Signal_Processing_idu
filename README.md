# Introduction
The codes are related to speech processing and are as follows:
### Windowing_FastFourierTransform_Spectrogram_of_speech_signal.ipynb                                                                                                The code shows how to run simple audio analyses on speech signal, a wav sound of 44100 Hz sample rate. It is a mono file named 'speech_signal'. Windowing, Fast Fourier Transformation and Spectrogram were applied. The audio file can be found in the data folder.
### Edit_Distance_Between_Two_Strings.ipynb
The algorithm calculates the edit distance between threee different words sources and their corresponding words targets using recursive method.
